# netsleep
netsleep is a simple tool for windows that automatically disables your network adapter when the computer is idle to remove it from the network and protect it from hackers

## Usage:
```sh
netsleep.exe 10 "Local Area Connection"
```

Starts the program with a 10 second activity timeout, disables and enables the Local Area Connection.
To run properly the program needs to be ran as Administrator
The shortcut contains everything needed to start the program with the arguments, simply pin it to your taskbar and start it with one click!

## Project Roadmap

If enough interest is awakened I will make the program into a background application with a tackbar icon for management and multiple modes
